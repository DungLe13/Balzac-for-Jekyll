Despite of its quotidian usage, map is still one of the most underappreciated object/application in one's life. Ten out of ten people you ask on the street will have either Google map or Apple map on their mobile device. In fact, map application is the one application that no smartphone user will delete no matter how short their phone storage is. Yet, how come something that is so popular is in fact underappreciated? Map is underappreciated in the same way that a wealthy man is unappreciated to his everyday meal or the way that a teenager takes his parents' words and advices for granted. These situations are similar in the way that when the objects – money for the wealthy man and parents for the teenager – are lost, people will realize that their life has been overly dependent on these objects that they once took for granted. Not many of us has ever asked ourselves the question of what will happen if one day maps just disappear. Or even worst, what will happen if maps were never been recorded? Could Columbus discover the Americas simply by gazing at the stars and the sun? It hasn't until these questions were raised do we realize how important maps have become since the beginning of the expedition period.

In the recent years, during the digitalization of data and knowledge, a new kind of cartography is introduced, known as digital map (or web map). The introduction of web map has changed the way maps are made and used in the daily life. I still remembered when I was in middle school, when smartphone hasn't been so "smart", whenever I needed to go out, I would have to open the map to redraw its path and road names on a small piece of paper before going out. Nowadays, with the aid of Google map, one just need to enter the designated destination, and the GPS device in one's car will take care of the way. It is much more convenient, yet, the drawback is that no one remembers the roads anymore. And it is totally understandable. Why should one bother to remember their ways when there is a device what will tell him or her to turn left in the next 500 meters? This brings me back to a point that we mentioned briefly in the first class: what will a person do when the road that a map shows is contradict to his knowledge? After being "bossed around" by a GPS device for so long, will one still be confident in his knowledge? Each person will have his or her own answer to this question. Yet, if I have to say something about this, it will be: no matter it is a left-turn or right-turn, every road takes one to the place where one's heart belongs.
